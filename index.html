    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    <p>Welcome to my webpage! I am currently working on my Ph.D in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I joined the Department of Computer Science in Fall 2018. My primary advisor is Dr. Xinwen Fu, and my co-advisor is Dr. Cliff Zou. I am primarily interested in IoT security and forensics.</p>

    <p>Prior to UCF, I received my Bachelor of Science from Stetson University in May 2018. My advisor was Dr. Daniel Plante.</p>

    <p>You can check out some of my current and former research projects, my CV, and contact information through this webpage.</p>

    <center><h2>Some Projects I've Worked On</h2></center>

    <center><h3>Fuzzing Works</h3></center>

    <p>This is just a collection of the top fuzzing papers in the literature. Currently, it only documents papers from the following conferences: IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, USENIX, and ISOC NDSS. Papers from 2015 and earlier are not included. I have done my best to provide an accurate summary for each paper, which you can think of as an alternative to the paper's abstract. This is still a work-in-progress, and contributions are welcome.</p> 
    
    <p>The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/PBearson/Fuzzing_Works">here</a>.</p>
